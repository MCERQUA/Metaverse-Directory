# Panorama Display Fix Documentation

## Issue
Both Mike's Room and White Space interactive space cards were not displaying their 360° panorama views correctly after recent changes.

## Root Cause
The `InteractiveSpaceCard` component was checking for both `isRealSpace && image360` conditions before rendering the PanoramaViewer. This double condition was preventing the panorama from displaying even when `image360` was provided.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Conditional Rendering
Changed from:
```tsx
{isRealSpace && image360 ? (
  <PanoramaViewer ... />
) : (
  <div ... />
)}
```

To:
```tsx
{image360 ? (
  <PanoramaViewer ... />
) : (
  <div ... />
)}
```

### 2. Fixed TypeScript Types
Updated the interface to properly handle optional image360:
```tsx
interface InteractiveSpaceCardProps {
  image360?: string | null  // Made optional with null support
  liveUrl?: string         // Also made optional
}
```

### 3. Improved Unique IDs
Changed panorama viewer IDs to be more unique using the space name:
```tsx
id={`card-panorama-${name.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '-')}-${id}`}
```

## Files Modified
- `/components/space-grid/interactive-space-card.tsx`
- `/components/panorama-viewer.tsx` (removed debug logs)

## Testing
Both space cards now correctly display:
- **Mike's Room**: Shows `/room1-360.jpg` panorama with auto-rotation
- **White Space**: Shows `/white-room.jpg` panorama with auto-rotation

## Notes
- The `isRealSpace` flag is still used for displaying the "LIVE" badge
- Both panorama images exist in the `/public` directory
- The PanoramaViewer component uses Pannellum library for 360° viewing
- Each panorama instance needs a unique ID to prevent conflicts
